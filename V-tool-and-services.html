                <p> This section describes some of the most important international tools and services available for disaster response in Asia and the Pacific. </p>
                <p> As previously explained, the primary responders in any emergency are disaster-affected communities and their Governments. International tools and services are only activated when disaster response needs exceed national capacities and an affected Government requests and/ or accepts international assistance. There are also technical services that can be triggered to support national Governments and international organizations in their response. For the purposes of the Guide, technical services include everything from pre-positioned supplies to communications technology packages to emergency surge rosters. This section covers international tools and services under the following areas: </p>

                    <p> A range of international technical teams can be mobilized within hours of a disaster to support a Government’s relief efforts. Described here are the purpose, composition and activation modalities of bilateral, intergovernmental and RCRC Movement technical teams. These teams are generally deployed in large and sometimes medium-scale disasters. They exist in addition to the many sector-specific technical teams deployed by Governments, clusters, and other individual agencies and are designed to complement their work. </p>

                <p>
                    <span><a href="https://www.insarag.org/" title="" target="_blank">Urban Search and Rescue Teams (USAR)</a></span> are composed of trained experts who provide rescue and rescue assistance in an emergency such as earthquakes or structural collapse. USAR teams that deploy internationally generally comprise expert personnel, specialized equipment and search dogs. They can be operational within 24 to 48 hours of a disaster. USAR teams are offered and received bilaterally and/or with coordination support from the OCHA-managed International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG). The advantage of working with INSARAG to receive international USAR teams is that their precise capacities and capabilities are specified through an INSARAG External Classification (IEC) system and the teams work according to internationally-agreed standards and modalities. </p>
                <p> Training in the INSARAG Guidelines and Methodology provides technical expertise in international USAR response according to the following phases: preparedness, mobilization, operations, demobilization and post-mission. INSARAG training is designed so that in an emergency, USAR teams share internationally accepted procedures and systems for sustained cooperation. </p>
                <p> In addition to engagement with the INSARAG Guidelines, INSARAG member countries with USAR teams deploying internationally are encouraged to apply for IEC. The IEC is an independent, peer-review of international USAR teams that have been endorsed by INSARAG. <button type="button" class="btn-tootltip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="It should be noted that IEC Classification is a multi-year process and there is a waitlist to become certified. IEC teams are expected to undergo reclassification every five years.">1</button> The IEC classifies teams as “Medium” or “Heavy” to ensure that only qualified and appropriate USAR resources are deployed in an emergency. <button type="button" class="btn-tootltip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="“Light” USAR teams are also very important due to their speed and agility in reaching disaster-affected communities, but they are primarily designed for deployment at the national level.">2</button> In Asia-Pacific, there are currently eight USAR teams classified by INSARAG as heavy. There are five more whose classification is currently in progress (Figure 13). </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>USAR Coordination Cell (UCC)</strong> is part of the On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (OSOCC), a common platform for the coordination of international response activities (See page 65 for more details). The UCC uses the INSARAG methodology to coordinate international USAR teams in support of and in cooperation with the national authorities. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> USAR teams support the search-and-rescue efforts of national Governments, particularly in urban settings where there are collapsed structures. INSARAG training is available to any Government or organization with a stake in USAR. USAR Coordination Cell training supports Government-led coordination of deploying USAR teams in a response. </p>

                <h3 class="title-third">MEDIUM AND HEAVY USAR TEAMS</h3>
                <p>INSARAG classifies USAR teams into three categories: light, medium, and heavy.</p>
                <p> 1. <strong>Light USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to assist with surface search and rescue in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Light USAR teams are not normally recommended for international deployment. </p>
                <p> 2. <strong>Medium USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to conduct technical search and rescue operations in structural-collapse incidents. Medium USAR teams are required to be able to search for trapped people. International Medium USAR teams travelling to an affected country should be operational in the affected country within 32 hours of when the disaster is posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A medium team must be adequately staffed to allow for 24-hour operations at one site for up to seven days. </p>
                <p> 3. <strong>Heavy USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability for difficult and technical search-and-rescue operations. Heavy USAR teams are required to be able to search for trapped people and use canine and technical systems. They are also required to provide international assistance in disasters resulting in the collapse of multiple structures, typically in urban settings, when national response capacity has either been overwhelmed or does not have the required capability. International heavy USAR teams travelling to an affected country should be operational in the affected country within 48 hours of when the disaster is posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A heavy team must be adequately resourced to allow for 24-hour operations at two separate sites for up to 10 days. <small>Source: INSARAG Guidelines.</small>

                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> A Government seeking assistance in activating international USAR teams through INSARAG can do so through a pre-identified INSARAG National Focal Point or directly through the INSARAG secretariat at insarag@un.org. Countries interested in joining the INSARAG network or participating in INSARAG or UCC training can contact the INSARAG secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland at <a href="mailto:insarag@un.org">insarag@un.org</a>. OCHA-ROAP is also a liaison between countries in Asia and the Pacific and INSARAG, and it can be contacted at <a href="mailto:ocha-roap@un.org">ocha-roap@un.org</a>. Account access to the Virtual OSOCC can be requested at <a href="https://vosocc.unocha.org/" target="_blank">vosocc.unocha.org</a> (See page 65 for more details on Virtual OSOCC) </p>

                    <span><a href="https://extranet.who.int/emt/page/home" title="" target="_blank">Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs)</a></span> are groups of health professionals providing direct clinical care to populations affected by outbreaks and emergencies. EMTs are deployed to augment a strained or overwhelmed local health system. EMT’s include governmental (both civilian and military) and non-governmental teams and can be comprised of both national and international staff. EMTs are an important part of the global health emergency workforce and should provide a predictable, timely and self-sufficient clinical response to assist member states during emergencies, particularly disasters and outbreaks. </p>
                <p> The WHO EMT Initiative assists organizations and member states to build capacity and strengthen health systems by coordinating the deployment of quality assured medical teams in emergencies. The WHO EMT initiative also supports Governments in building their own national EMTs. These can be deployed when needed and can achieve international classification for response in neighbouring countries. </p>
                <p> WHO has developed a global classification system to ‘quality assure’ EMTs through peer review. There is also a global list of all EMTs that meet the WHO EMT minimum standards for deployment and who provide quality assured, clinical capacity to affected populations. This allows a country affected by a disaster or other emergency to call on classified and quality assured EMTs, ideally from their neighbours within the region. There are currently five classified governmental EMT teams in the Asia-Pacific region. There are an additional 12 NGO or governmental EMT teams whose classification is in progress (Figure 14). </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>EMT Coordination Cells (EMTCC)</strong> help national Ministries of Health coordinate the tasking, management and reporting of national and international EMTs. They are part of the OSOCC and are usually housed in the case management pillar of existing Ministry of Health emergency operations centres. </p>

It is simultaneously a place and a methodology, similar to a national Government’s Emergency Operations Centre, but adapted in line with its function within the international humanitarian system. There is an online OSOCC Awareness course that offers a basic understanding of the functioning and management of an OSOCC and explains the purpose, roles, structure, principles and functions of the OSOCC system. This can be accessed through the Virtual OSOCC platform.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>The Reception and Departure Centre (RDC)</strong> is part of the On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (OSOCC). The RDC focuses on registering incoming teams, particularly USAR and EMT, and providing basic information about the situation, the operations of national and international responders, and logistical arrangements.</li><br>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://vosocc.unocha.org/" title="" target="_blank">Virtual On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (VOSOCC)</a></strong> is a global online network and information portal that facilitates data exchange between disaster responders and affected counties before, during and after sudden-onset disasters.

                </ol>
                <p> UNDAC training is offered via two courses: the UNDAC Induction Course and the UNDAC Refresher Course. The Induction Course is a two-week training that gives participants applicable knowledge about UNDAC’s core activities: assessment, coordination and information management. The Refresher Course is a four to five-day training course that UNDAC roster participants are required to take every two years to maintain these skill levels. UNDAC training is available to representatives of UNDAC and UNDAC participating countries. Representatives are generally from Government entities, OCHA and UN agencies, but they can also be from NGOs. Once the course is completed, participants are eligible to be added to the UNDAC emergency response roster. UNDAC roster participants are expected to be available at least two to three times a year for emergency missions. </p>
                <p> UNDAC can evaluate and recommend ways to strengthen national response preparedness, including policies and legislation. The missions are generally conducted over two weeks. The UNDAC team then periodically reviews the progress made implementing the recommendations. </p>

                    <span><a href="https://www.ahacentre.org" title="" target="_blank">ASEAN Emergency Response and Assessment Team (ERAT)</a></span> members are trained and rapidly deployable (within 24 hours) experts in emergency assessments that are available for disasters in ASEAN countries. Since 2008, 85 ERAT have been deployed for 21 missions in the Asia-Pacific region (see Figure 16). The purpose of ERAT is to assist NDMOs in the earliest phase of an emergency in a variety of areas, including (1) conducting rapid assessments; (2) estimating the scale, severity and impact of the disaster through a damage assessment and needs analysis; (3) gathering information and reporting on the immediate needs of affected people; and (4) coordinating with the AHA Centre to mobilize and deploy regional disaster management assets, and humanitarian goods and assistance to the disaster- affected areas. </p>
                <p> ERAT team establishes a <strong>Joint Operations and Coordination Centre of ASEAN (JOCCA)</strong> as an on-site coordination system to enhance ASEAN’s collective response during large-scale disaster response in the ASEAN region and support the Government of the affected Member State. The JOCCA falls under the coordination and leadership of the affected Member States’ NDMO and, whenever possible, is co-located with the NDMO. The JOCCA has three primary objectives: (1) to support the NDMO to establish an on-site system for receiving and coordinating incoming relief assistance from ASEAN Member States; (2) to establish a physical space as a single point of service for response entities from ASEAN Member States, civil society organizations, the private sector and other ASEAN responders; and (3) to establish a coordination platform at the field level with relevant United Nations agencies and other international organizations. The JOCCA primarily focuses on facilitating international assistance from the ASEAN region. </p>
                <p> ERAT members are trained NDMOs or staff of related ministries, but they are also partners and stakeholders from within the 10 ASEAN Member States. This enables stronger collaboration with the affected ASEAN Member States’ Government and communities. </p>
                <p> The ERAT induction course trains disaster managers from ASEAN Member States on how to assist affected Governments and the AHA Centre in meeting regional and/or international needs for coordination, and for early and quality information during the initial phase of a sudden-onset emergency. ERAT induction courses are conducted over nine days of classroom sessions and simulation exercises. The induction course focuses on assessment, coordination, information management and equipment use within the AADMER operational framework. ERAT induction courses, with support from OCHA, have also covered UNDAC methodologies. </p>

                    <h4>MANAGING INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL TEAM DEPLOYMENT</h4>
                    <p> One of the main challenges for disaster-affected Governments in the initial hours and days of an emergency is managing numerous offers of assistance, including offers to deploy USAR, EMT and other technical response teams. In the midst of a crisis, it can be difficult for Governments to evaluate what is and is not required. It can also be difficult to turn down offers of assistance. </p>
                    <p> Although international USAR and medical teams can be critical to response to larger- scale disasters, national teams are usually responsible for the highest percentage of life-saving activities in an emergency. National teams are locally based, so they can immediately start operating when the disaster strikes. International USAR, medical and other technical teams should only be requested or accepted if national capacity has been overwhelmed. </p>
                    <p> For this reason, Governments should think ahead about the types of disaster risk they face and evaluate the types of technical assistance they might need, from whom, and in what order of priority. Some teams can be requested to arrive in anticipation of need. For example, if a typhoon is expected to affect a certain area or population, teams can arrive before the storm hinders the ability to do so. </p>
                    <p> Governments can also request UNDAC or ASEAN ERAT teams to manage the process of accepting or declining international offers of assistance on their behalf. This allows Government officials to focus on delivering assistance to affected people through the national response resources. </p>

                        <span><a href="https://www.unocha.org/our-work/coordination/surge-capacity" title="" target="_blank">OCHA Emergency Surge Mechanisms</a></span> are the means by which staff can be rapidly deployed to address critical new or unforeseen humanitarian needs in the field. In OCHA, “surge” means the swift deployment of experienced coordination experts and other specialized humanitarian personnel. Surge capacity is used when there are unforeseen emergencies and disasters, when a crisis deteriorates, or when a force majeure affects an office. </p>
                    <p> OCHA mobilizes surge staff from regional offices and from surge mechanisms managed by OCHA’s Response Services Section (RSS) within the Emergency Response Support Branch (ERSB) in Geneva, Switzerland. These mechanisms are the Emergency Response Roster (ERR) and the Associates Surge Pool (ASP). </p>
                    <p> The <strong>Emergency Response Roster (ERR)</strong> comprises 45 OCHA staff enrolled in the ERR for deployment, usually for six weeks, at short notice. For a L3 emergency, staff can be deployed for up to three months. </p>
                    <p> The <strong>Roaming Emergency Surge Officer (RESO)</strong> are senior staff who can deploy at short notice to fill management and senior coordination capability gaps. A RESO may also be called upon to carry out ‘reconnaissance’ missions in emergencies to a) assist in determining OCHA’s footprint, b) advise on additional surge deployment needs, and c) advise on staff continuity planning and associated operational requirements. RESO deployment durations are needs- based and range from a few weeks to several months. </p>
                    <p> The <strong>Associate Surge Pool (ASP)</strong> covers needs following the departure of surge staff and the arrival of regularly recruited staff. It also addresses critical mid-term staffing gaps. The ASP is composed of experienced humanitarian workers pre-cleared to deploy on a Temporary Appointment. Contracting and deployment take an average of three to four weeks. Deployment duration is usually three to six months with the possibility to extend up to 364 days. </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Stand-by Partnerships (SBP)</strong> are the agreements OCHA has with 14 partner organizations to provide short-term staffing as ‘gratis personnel’ to meet emergency human resource gaps. Partners maintain their own rosters of trained and experienced humanitarian professionals, many of whom have prior OCHA or other humanitarian experience. SBP staff can usually be deployed within four weeks from receipt of a request, for a period of up to six months. </p>

                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> OCHA offices contact the roster managers through internal channels. More information can be requested from OCHA ROAP at <a href="mailto:ocha-roap@un.org"> ocha-roap@un.org</a>

                    <span><a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/" title="" target="_blank">Inter-Agency Rapid Response Mechanism (IARRM)</a></span> is a commitment made by IASC member agencies to maintain a roster of senior and experienced staff that can be deployed in the event of a major emergency. These staff can support the HCT in defining and implementing the humanitarian response. The IARRM is not a stand-alone team, but a composite of the individual rapid response capacities of participating agencies. </p>
                <p> When required, the <strong>Emergency Directors Group (EDG)</strong> makes a set of shared recommendations to the IASC Principals concerning the composition of the IARRM deployment based on the context of the response, including rapid/slow onset and protracted situations; the existing capacity on the ground; and related logistical and access considerations. The EDG’s recommendations aim to find the most practical deployment solution for the response requirements based on information available at the time. The participating agencies then fill the identified positions through their own surge mechanisms. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> IARRM staff work under their individual organizations, and consequently, under the direction of the HC. They help the HCT deliver an effective international response that meets the actual needs of the affected population within the overall framework of the national response. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> Deployment of the IARRM is decided by the IASC Principals, who meet within 48 hours of the onset of an L3 emergency, and is based on the recommendation of the IASC Emergency Directors. All IASC members have committed to place emergency roster members on standby at the announcement of the planned meeting of the IASC Principals. More information can be requested from OCHA ROAP at <a href="mailto:ocha-roap@un.org"> ocha-roap@un.org</a> or found at <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/iasc-transformative-agenda" target="_blank">interagencystandingcommittee.org/iasc-transformative-agenda</a>. </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Cluster-based surge mechanisms</span> provide important technical standby and surge capacities to humanitarian organizations from the onset of an emergency. They are managed by some cluster lead agencies. For example, two WFP-managed common service clusters are the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster and the Logistics Cluster. </p>
                <p> The <strong><a href="https://www.etcluster.org/" title="" target="_blank">Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)</a></strong> is a global network of organizations that work together to provide shared communications services in humanitarian emergencies. Within 48 hours of a disaster, the ETC provides vital security communications services,and voice and internet connectivity to assist the humanitarian response. This may include provision of services to affected people when required. </p>
                <p> The <strong><a href="https://www.logcluster.org/" title="" target="_blank">Logistics Cluster</a></strong> response teams provide logistics coordination for humanitarian organizations in an emergency. They ensure appropriate logistics information management and if needed, define a logistics strategy for the response. By coordinating the humanitarian community’s access to common logistics services, relief items can reach affected people more efficiently. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> Humanitarian organizations can utilize the in-country telecommunications and logistics support offered by the WFP-led global clusters. Representatives from aid organizations interested in participating in ICT or logistics coordination and information sharing can attend local working group meetings. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>

In total, NORCAP has a pool of more than 1,000 professionals who meet the changing demands of a wide range of partners, contexts and crises. </p>
                <p> Since establishing the roster in 1991, NORCAP’s main focus has been developing and strengthening crisis response. NORCAP provides a range of expertise. These include protection, coordination, education, health and nutrition, communication with affected populations, camp management and resilience. NORCAP, in cooperation with partners, covers the following thematic areas through specialized projects: </p>
                <p> The <strong>Protection Standby Capacity Roster (ProCap)</strong> consists of senior protection specialists who are recruited and deployed by NORCAP to field, regional and global operations, thereby, strengthening the humanitarian protection response. ProCap advisers also train mid-level protection staff from standby partners and UN agencies. ProCap is an inter-agency initiative created in 2005 and led by OCHA. </p>
                <p> The <strong>Gender Standby Capacity Roster (GenCap)</strong> deploys senior gender experts who work with multiple agencies simultaneously to enhance their capacity to undertake and promote gender equality programming. GenCap is also a UN inter-agency project led by OCHA. </p>
                <p> The <strong>Cash and Markets Capacity Development Roster (CashCap)</strong> deploys specialists to increase the use and effectiveness of cash programming in humanitarian aid. It is governed by a steering committee of UN and NGO members. </p>
                <p> The <strong>Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS)</strong> provides accessible assessment expertise, timely data and analysis to inform decision-making by national Governments and HCTs. </p>

                    <p> Managing information following a disaster is a crucial part of any humanitarian response. Strong information management requires agreed processes and trained personnel to collect, analyse and share information about a disaster situation. Affected people, affected Governments, humanitarian organizations and the media are all sources and users of information in an emergency. </p>
                    <p> Governments have their own mechanisms for sharing and managing information between emergency response-related agencies and ministries. This section explains how the international humanitarian community manages information in an emergency so that Governments better understand how Governments and international organizations can work together and share information. </p>

                    <span>OCHA Information Management Unit (OCHA-IMU)</span> provides dedicated information management in countries where there is an ongoing emergency response. This includes technical staff who serve the humanitarian community by developing and promoting common standards that enable data exchange between organizations. They consolidate information to provide an overview of the humanitarian response. They also provide technical support to initiatives, such as needs assessments, and publish information products, such as contacts lists, meeting schedules and maps. The OCHA-IMU works through the Cluster Approach and in close collaboration with information management focal points in Government. To facilitate the exchange of data, an Information Management Working Group is often formed that includes IM staff from OCHA, key Government agencies (NDMO, National Statistics Agency, etc.) and cluster lead agencies. If there is no OCHA in the country, information management support is available through OCHA regional offices. </p>

A PDNA complements rather than duplicates initial rapid assessments conducted by humanitarian actors. It analyses these assessments to obtain recovery-related data. The Disaster Recovery Framework (DRF) is the principal output of the assessment. It is a single consolidated report that provides information on the physical impacts of a disaster; the economic cost of damage and loss; the human impacts as experienced by affected people; and the resulting early and long-term recovery needs and priorities. It provides a basis for the prioritization, design and implementation of a coherent set of recovery programmes. </p>
                <p> There are various stages and procedures necessary for a PDNA. In addition to the assessment, a PDNA includes a planning mission, an orientation meeting with all stakeholders, and sectoral training and orientation.

It allows users to collect data in the field using electronic devices. KoBo Toolbox supports the full data collection cycle - form design, data collection and analysis. Most users are people working in humanitarian crises or aid professionals and researchers working in developing countries. Its capacity to support the needs assessments, monitoring and other data collection activities for humanitarian actors in emergencies and difficult field environments continues to improve. The adaptation of KoBo Toolbox for humanitarian use is a joint initiative between OCHA and the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI). </p>
                <p> The platform provides a simple and intuitive interface to develop forms, including complex skipping logic, validation, and common humanitarian question formats. The form builder also supports a unique question library feature that enables users to develop and share libraries of validated and standardized questions. </p>
                <p> By making the sharing of data, questions and forms easier, users can work more quickly and effectively, and there is a greater adoption of standard indicators and questions, less fragmentation (which occurs if every agency uses a different incompatible system), and improved comparability between data sets. This allows better comparisons across time and across countries, so the entire humanitarian community, including donors, UN agencies and implementing partners benefit. </p>

                        <span><a href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/idrl/idrl-guidelines/" title="" target="_blank">Guidelines for the domestic facilitation and regulation of international disaster relief and initial recovery assistance (IDRL Guidelines)</a></span> are a set of recommendations to Governments on how to prepare their laws and plans for coordinating and facilitating international disaster relief. Such preparedness planning can include the review and development of disaster management laws, immigration laws, customs laws, quarantine procedures, and civil and criminal liability processes. </p>
                    <p> The Guidelines are complemented by various reference tools developed by the IFRC, including the <strong>IDRL Checklist; the Model Act</strong> for the Facilitation and Regulation of International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance (Model Act); and an emergency decree template. </p>
                    <p> The <strong>IDRL Checklist</strong> is an easy to use assessment tool that helps a Government to understand what legislation it has and what may be required to strengthen legal preparedness. </p>
                    <p> The <strong>Model Act</strong> supports national Governments’ legal preparedness for disasters. It helps Governments develop legislation that integrates the IDRL Guidelines into domestic law and policy. Implementing the IDRL Guidelines and the Model Act can contribute towards a timely response during a sudden onset disaster or emergency. </p>
                    <p> The <strong>emergency decree</strong> template can be used by a Government in times of disaster if there is no pre-existing framework in place for facilitating and regulating international disaster assistance. </p>
                    <p> The <strong>IFRC’s Disaster Law Programme (DLP)</strong> also helps integrate the IDRL Guidelines at the national level. The DLP supports RCRC National Societies’ work with their respective Governments to develop and apply state-of-the-art disaster-related legislation, policies and procedures, including legal preparedness for international disaster assistance. </p>

                    <h4>CASE STUDY 5. IDRL IN ACTION: THE CASES OF INDONESIA, CAMBODIA AND THE COOK ISLANDS</h4>
                    <p> Between 2004 and 2006, IFRC and the <strong>Indonesia</strong> Red Cross Society conducted a series of studies in collaboration with the Government to identify the legal issues that had affected international relief operations in that country. Following intensive consultations involving a wide range of stakeholders, the Government adopted a new law on disaster management in 2007. In 2008, the President promulgated Regulation No.23 on the Participation of International Institutions and Foreign Non-Governmental Institutions in Disaster Management, which draws strongly from the IDRL Guidelines. In December 2010, more detailed and specific guidelines were adopted, titled “The Role of International Organizations and Foreign Nongovernment Organizations during Emergency Response”. </p>
                    <p> Similarly, in 2008, IFRC supported the Government of <strong>Cambodia</strong> and the Cambodia Red Cross Society to undertake an IDRL technical assistance project to analyse the national legal framework for international assistance. Following this review, Cambodia drafted and adopted a new Disaster Management Law in June 2015. The Law, aimed at regulating disaster management in Cambodia, has the three stated goals of: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prevention, adaptation and mitigation of disaster risk in the pre-disaster period</li>
                        <li>Emergency response during a disaster</li>
                        <li>Recovery in the post-disaster period</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> The law establishes institutions, assigns them legally-binding roles and responsibilities, and helps ensure resources and mechanisms for coordination are allocated amongst different institutions. Currently, this is one of the most comprehensive disaster management laws in the Asia-Pacific region. </p>
                    <p> Like Indonesia and Cambodia, the IDRL Guidelines have been utilized to bolster disaster management preparedness in the Pacific. Following the completion of an IDRL study in the <strong>Cook Islands</strong>, the Prime Minister raised the importance of the IDRL Guidelines with leaders of Pacific Island States during the 43rd Pacific Island Forum in August 2012. The Forum Communiqué encourages the Pacific Island States to use the IDRL Guidelines to strengthen their national policy and their institutional and legal frameworks in collaboration with their National Red Cross Societies, IFRC, the UN and other relevant partners. </p>
                    <p> The IDRL Guidelines have had a significant impact across the Asia-Pacific region. Indonesia, New Zealand and the Philippines have adopted new laws, regulations or procedures at the national level with provisions inspired by, or consistent with, the IDRL Guidelines. In Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vanuatu and Viet Nam, legal review processes and/or IDRL studies conducted by IFRC and National Societies have been completed or are underway.

                <h4 class="title-blue">2. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PREPAREDNESS PLANNING</h4>
                <p>
                    <span><a href="https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/programme-cycle/space/page/preparedness" title="" target="_blank">IASC Emergency Response Preparedness (ERP) Guidance</a></span> enables the international humanitarian system to apply an operational approach to emergency preparedness. The primary objective of the ERP approach is to optimize the speed and volume of critical assistance delivered immediately after the onset of a humanitarian emergency. The ERP focuses on situations where the scale of the potential emergency requires the concerted action of a number of agencies/organizations. The ERP allows the humanitarian community to quickly state its capacity and the value it can add to national response. </p>
                <p>The ERP tool supports:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk Analysis by developing a common understanding of disaster or crisis risks and identifying moderate or high risks.</li><br>
                    <li>Operational Readiness by establishing a minimum level of multi-hazard preparedness to prepare for both slow and sudden-onset crisis and/or disasters.</li><br>
                    <li>Strategic Planning by designing a response strategy based on the available in-country capacity that can deal with the initial phase of an emergency if moderate or high risks are identified. This includes developing contingency plans for specific risks to meet the differentiated needs of an affected population in the first three to four weeks of a humanitarian emergency.</li><br>
                    <li>Coordination and Partnerships by outlining how the international humanitarian community can organize itself to support and complement national action.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The <strong>Rapid Response Approach to Disasters in Asia-Pacific (RAPID)</strong> is an Asia-Pacific adaptation of the ERP. It is designed to better support the unique context and challenges in the region, while also ensuring that the approach is flexible enough to be scaled according to specific contexts in line with global guidance. </p>
                <p> The RAPID approach is made up of four stages, that are mirrored in preparedness and response; <strong>1. Disaster Impact Model, 2. Needs Analysis, 3. Response Capacity Analysis, and 4. Planning and Advocacy</strong> (Figure 19) The RAPID approach: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Places national response at the forefront and articulating how the international humanitarian community augments Government preparedness and response.</li><br>
                    <li>Creates linkages between (1) disaster preparedness and response, and (2) the resilience and development agendas, by generating synergy with existing initiatives Governments have committed to, such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.</li><br>
                    <li>Engages affected people in response planning, thereby, improving accountability and better supporting local systems.</li><br>
                    <li>Uses country-specific risk profiles and vulnerability data to inform more context specific and appropriate responses in support of national efforts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> The ERP and RAPID approach should be as participatory as possible and should include all those likely to be involved in a response. </p>
                <p>The approach should be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Led by a Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Managed by a Humanitarian Country Team or equivalent body</li>
                    <li>Supported by an inter-cluster/sector coordination group and by the clusters/sectors</li>
                    <li>Inclusive of a broad range of responders, including at the sub-national level</li>
                    <li>Supportive of the national authorities, who have primary responsibility for affected people.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> To the extent possible, national authorities and other national actors should be engaged with or lead the preparedness planning processes so that there is a common understanding of the risks, vulnerabilities and capacities. Moreover, they can ensure that the efforts of the international humanitarian community feed into emergency preparedness planning. </p>

                    <span><a href="https://ahacentre.org/publication/ajdrp/" title="" target="_blank">ASEAN Joint Disaster Response Plan (AJDRP)</a></span> is a regional preparedness approach that provides a common framework for delivering a timely, at-scale and joint response by mobilizing necessary assets and capacities. The AJDRP clarifies the working arrangements of ASEAN’s mechanisms in strengthening engagement with other sectors and stakeholders as part of the overall ASEAN response to a large-scale disaster in the region. The AJDRP also assists ASEAN Member States and other partners to identify standby resources. These assets, experts and other response capacities may come from the private sector, civil society organizations, or military resources, and constitute the <strong>ASEAN Standby Arrangements.</strong>
                </p>
                <p> The <strong>ASEAN Regional Disaster Emergency Response Simulation Exercise (ARDEX)</strong> is conducted every two years by the ACDM to test and validate ASEAN SASOP and ASEAN’s preparedness and readiness in times of disasters. The first ARDEX was held in 2005, and the AHA Centre has co-organized the ARDEX with the host country since 2013. To support planning and conduct of the ARDEX, the AHA Centre has developed an ARDEX Organizer’s Handbook and ARDEX Referees Manual. Since the 2016 ARDEX in Brunei Darussalam, the exercise has also tested ASEAN’s readiness for collective response under the One ASEAN One Response Declaration. </p>
                <p> ASEAN Member States and partners in disaster response, including military forces, the United Nations, NGOs, international organizations, civil society and the private sector participate in the ARDEX. </p>
                <p> The <strong>ASEAN Regional Forum Disaster Relief Exercise (ARF DiREx)</strong>‎ is also a large-scale disaster relief exercise that ARF members’ civilian and military authorities hold every two years (opposite years to the ARDEX). It promotes the exchange of expertise and practices in disaster management among ARF members. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> The AJDRP is developed for specific scenarios in ASEAN Member States at the highest risk of a large-scale disaster. It is intended to facilitate planning among ASEAN Member States and their disaster response partners, including military forces, UN agencies, international NGOs, civil society and private sector, among others. ASEAN – and ARF – partners are also invited to participate in the ARDEX and ARF-DiREx exercises. </p>

                    <p> When a crisis hits, immediate access to funds to begin coordinated inter-agency response planning and humanitarian operations is critical to save lives and alleviate human suffering. This section describes international and regional multilateral financing and strategic planning tools that can be triggered during the immediate phase of an emergency. In Asia and the Pacific, national humanitarian financing mechanisms, bilateral contributions and private donations are central to rapid disaster response. </p>

                    <span><a href="https://cerf.un.org/" title="" target="_blank">UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)</a></span> delivers funding quickly to humanitarian responders and kick-starts life-saving action. The CERF, established in 2006, comprises three components: 1) Rapid Response grants, 2) Underfunded Emergencies grants, and 3) loans. </p>
                <p> CERF makes funding available when a sudden-onset emergency begins, when an ongoing crisis suddenly deteriorates or when a response to a slow-onset crisis requires time-critical funding. Rapid Response grants can be approved in as little as 48 hours. For the world’s neglected crises, CERF provides support through Underfunded Emergencies grants. These are disbursed twice a year to provide much needed funding for critical life-saving services. The CERF also has a loan facility of US$ 30 million. Loans of up to one year can be made for UN agencies if they can confirm that donor funding is forthcoming. </p>
                <p> In recognition of the critical need for larger and more strategic humanitarian finance and CERF’s track record of providing life-saving assistance to crisis-affected people, the UN General Assembly has endorsed the call to expand CERF’s annual funding target from $450 million to $1 billion. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> CERF funding is available only to UN agencies, funds and programmes. However, NGOs are important CERF partners and receive CERF funding when they carry out work in partnership with recipient UN organizations. Between 2013 and 2017, countries in the Asia-Pacific region received some US$ 338 million in CERF funding (Figure 21), with major recipient countries in 2016 and 2017 including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Fiji and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (Figure 20). </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> A CERF grant application is coordinated and submitted by the RC or RC/HC on behalf of the country team.

They are managed locally by the HC in consultation with the humanitarian community. Contributions – mainly from Governments – are collected into single, unearmarked funds to support local humanitarian efforts. Money is allocated through an inclusive and transparent process in support of priorities set out in coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs). This ensures that funding is available and prioritized at the local level by those closest to people in need. </p>
                <p> CBPFs allocate funding based on identified humanitarian needs and priorities at the country- level in line with the Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC). To avoid duplication and ensure a complementary use of the available CBPF funding, other funding sources, including bilateral contributions, are considered. </p>
                <p> CBPFs help in-country relief organizations to reach the most vulnerable people and use available resources more effectively and efficiently. </p>

                    <li><strong>CBPFs are inclusive and promote partnership.</strong> Funds are directly available to a wide range of relief partners. This empowers humanitarian leadership and encourages collaboration and collective ownership of the emergency response.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>CBPFs are timely and flexible.</strong> They support the delivery of an agile response in fluid emergency situations.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>CBPFs are efficient and accountable.</strong> They minimize transaction costs and provide transparency and accountability. Recipient organizations are thoroughly assessed; relief projects are monitored with regular reporting on achievement. In the Agenda for Humanity, the UN Secretary-General stressed the critical role of CBPFs, and he called on donors to increase the proportion of humanitarian funding channelled through CBPFs to 15 per cent by 2018. At current levels, that would equal more than $2 billion per year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> In 2017, there were 18 active CBPFs globally, which received a combined total of $824 million and allocated more than $586 million to 614 partners in 18 countries to support 1,130 critical humanitarian projects that provided millions of people with health care, food aid, clean water and sanitation, shelter, and other life-saving assistance. The largest CBPFs operated in Yemen ($95.2 million), Ethiopia ($81.4 million) and Iraq ($71.7 million). Additionally, funds allocated by several CBPFs in support of people affected by the Syria crisis totalled $79.1 million and represents allocations in Jordan ($8.5 million), Lebanon ($5.7 million), Syria ($23.8 million) and Turkey ($41.1 million). In Asia and the Pacific, CBPFs are operational in Afghanistan, Myanmar and Pakistan. </p>

                <p> CBPFs are locally managed by the OCHA Country Office under the leadership of the HC. An advisory board oversees the management of CBPFs, providing advice on key decisions and ensuring that they are efficiently and effectively managed in compliance with policies and standards. At the global-level, the Pooled Fund Working Group (PFWG) brings together key stakeholders (representing donors, NGOs and UN agencies) to provide policy guidance.

                    <span>Emergency Cash Grant (ECG)</span> assists countries affected by natural disasters. These grants enable OCHA to quickly release funds to support relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. As the custodian of the fund, OCHA evaluates requests and make determinations on the appropriate allocation of cash grants. The allocation amount per disaster cannot exceed $100,000. The ECG was established by UN General Assembly Resolution 2816 in 1971 and later amended and updated by subsequent resolutions. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> The RC Office (or, if applicable, the RC/HC) drafts the grant request, and—if approved— receives the disbursed funds and determines allocation in consultation with in-country partners. The RC/HC establishes the implementation arrangements, either through direct purchasing by UNDP or by channeling the funds to an implementing partner, such as a governmental service, a UN agency or fund, the Red Cross/Crescent, or an NGO. Regardless of the channeling mechanism, the RC/HC remains responsible for the use of the funds. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> Requests for Emergency Cash Grants can be initiated from different sources, including the Office of the RC/HC, the OCHA Country or Regional Office, the Permanent Mission in Geneva or New York or directly from the Government of the affected country. Upon verification that the recipient country has requested and welcomes international assistance, the Office of the RC/HC prepares a written request to the OCHA Director of Operations. </p>

                    <span><a href="https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/dref/" title="" target="_blank">IFRC Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF)</a></span> is a pool of un-earmarked funds that are reserved to ensure a rapid response by National Societies in disasters, crises and health emergencies. The DREF can provide amounts for both small and large-scale operations. DREF finances short-term relief to preserve life and provide basic sustenance. Allocations range from 20,000 Swiss Francs (CHF) to one million CHF. </p>
                <p> If the scale of planned interventions cannot be met by a DREF alone, an emergency appeal may be launched. This is an international marketing and positioning document launched by the IFRC at the request of a National Society to generate funding. An appeal budget may cover the cost of FACT, ERUs, RDRTs and other IFRC global response tools, as well as the mobilization of international and national staff. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> DREF is available to all 190 National Societies and has two main purposes. It provides funding for the IFRC and National Societies to respond to large scale disasters (loan facility), and for National Society responses to small- and medium-scale disasters and health emergencies for which no international appeal will be launched or when support from other actors is not foreseen (grant facility). </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> DREF is managed by the IFRC Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland. All requests for DREF allocations are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Funds can be authorized and released within 24 hours. For more information, visit <a href="https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/dref/" title="" target="_blank">media.ifrc.org/ifrc/dref</a>

                    <span><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/pef" title="" target="_blank">Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF)</a></span> provides surge funding for response efforts to help prevent rare, high-severity disease outbreaks from becoming more deadly and costly pandemics. The PEF covers six viruses that are most likely to cause a pandemic, including new Orthomyxoviruses (new influenza pandemic virus A), Coronaviridae (SARS, MERS), Filoviridae (Ebola, Marburg) and other zoonotic diseases (Crimean Congo, Rift Valley, Lassa fever). The PEF was developed in 2016 by the World Bank Group in collaboration with the WHO, and it is supported by Japan and Germany as well as private sector partners. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> The PEF covers all low-income countries that qualify for credits from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA). Eligible countries can receive timely, predictable, and coordinated surge financing if affected by an outbreak that meets PEF’s activation criteria. PEF also provides funding to PEF-accredited international agencies involved in the response to a major outbreak. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> Through a combination of insurance financed by bonds and derivatives, the PEF insurance window will make available up to $425 million for outbreaks of the six covered viruses that meet the activation criteria. To complement the insurance window, the PEF also has a $55 million cash window. This provides the flexibility to make resources available for outbreaks that have not met, or will not meet, the criteria of the insurance window. The cash window covers a wider range of infectious disease outbreaks as well as single-country outbreaks. The insurance window, operational since July 2017, has an initial period of 3 years (with the possibility of being extended), and the cash window will be operational in 2018. </p>
                <p> The PEF’s insurance window will rely on clear, parametric activation criteria designed with publicly available data. To be eligible for PEF financing under the insurance window, an outbreak must meet specific criteria related to its severity. These criteria are based on the size, growth and spread of the outbreak. If these criteria are met, then the affected countries and/ or eligible international responders may submit a request for funding from the PEF.

The APDRF helps bridge the gap between existing ADB arrangements that support disaster risk reduction and early recovery and reconstruction assistance. </p>
                <p> APDRF provides grants up to $3 million per event. Factors that may influence the size of the grant include (1) the geographical extent of damage; (2) initial estimates of people affected; (3) the response capacity of key Government agencies in the country; and (4) the date and magnitude of the last disaster that affected the country (thereby taking into account the cumulative effect of the disaster on a country’s ability to respond). Each distinct declaration of a disaster is regarded as a separate event and is eligible for assistance. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">WHO IS IT FOR?</h5>
                <p> All ADB DMCs are eligible for grant assistance from the APDRF. The grants are provided to central Governments. They may then allocate funds to specific national and local Government agencies and to other suitable national or international entities, including NGOs. </p>
                <h5 class="title-five">HOW IS IT ACCESSED?</h5>
                <p> Assistance may be granted once the following emergency conditions have been met: (1) a natural disaster has occurred in a DMC; (2) an emergency has been officially declared that is of a scale beyond the capacity of the country and its own agencies to meet the immediate expenses necessary to restore life-saving services to the affected populations; and (3) the UN HC/RC has confirmed the scale and implications of the disaster and has indicated a general amount of funding that would be required to assist in alleviating the situation.

The plan articulates the shared vision of how to respond to the assessed and expressed needs of the affected population. The development of an HRP is a key step in the <strong>Humanitarian Programme Cycle</strong> and is carried out only when humanitarian needs have been understood and analysed through the <strong>Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO).</strong> The HRP is generally launched when humanitarian needs extend beyond the period of a Flash Appeal and may form part of a multi-year response strategy. </p>

                <p> The HRP is a response planning tool for country-based decision makers, such as the HC and Humanitarian Country Team, UN agencies, local and international NGOs, and cluster coordinators. Once a common strategy is agreed upon, UN agencies, NGOs and the RCRC Movement develop projects to support the operationalization of the strategy. </p>
