                <p> The first responders in any emergency are crisis-affected people, community-based and local organizations, and Government agencies. Central Governments may also request external support from regional partners and/or the international humanitarian system. While national legal systems are the main regulatory frameworks for protecting disaster-affected people, provision of international humanitarian assistance is guided by the UN General Assembly resolution 46/182 (1991) “Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of the United Nations”. The resolution provides the framework for emergency relief and informs the work of the humanitarian system today. It lays out 12 guiding principles for humanitarian action and enshrines the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, and impartiality. Subsequent UN General Assembly resolutions on strengthening the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance have reinforced General Assembly resolution 46/182 and expanded the core humanitarian principles to also include operational independence (Figure 3). </p>

                </figure>
                <p> Humanitarian action is also regulated by binding and non-binding international humanitarian and human rights law. The 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols adopted in 1977 and 2005 form the core of international humanitarian law, which regulates the conduct of armed conflict and seeks to limit its effects. The Geneva Conventions have been ratified by all States and are universally applicable. </p>

                    <h3>THE PURPOSE OF HUMANITARIAN REGULATORY AGREEMENTS</h3>
                    <strong>The regulation of international humanitarian action serves three main functions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It safeguards the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.</li>
                        <li>It guarantees fundamental rights and protection for disaster-affected communities.</li>
                        <li>It rationalizes the roles and responsibilities between humanitarian actors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <p> Additional regulation of international humanitarian action in Asia and the Pacific can be understood according to three categories: (a) non-binding regulatory agreements between States; (b) binding regulatory agreements between States; and (c) voluntary guidelines governing humanitarian action by State and non-state actors. The Guide does not list all the regulatory documents that could be applicable in a disaster. Instead, it focuses on those most relevant to humanitarian action in the region. </p>

                <p> Through its <strong>Standard Operating Procedure for Regional Standby Arrangements and Coordination of Joint Disaster Relief and Emergency Response Operations (SASOP),</strong> the AADMER enables ASEAN Member States to mobilize and deploy resources for emergency response. The SASOP guides the actions of the ASEAN Member States and the operational </p>

                <p> Inspired by ASEAN’s 2013 response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the <strong>ASEAN Declaration on One ASEAN One Response: ASEAN Responding to Disasters as One in the Region and Outside the Region</strong> increases the speed, scale and solidarity of ASEAN’s response. The Declaration affirms the AHA Centre as the primary regional coordinating agency on disaster management and emergency response. The AHA Centre is tasked with developing the necessary protocols, procedures and standards to operationalize the Declaration, including through engagement with other relevant sectors and stakeholders in ASEAN. It was signed by ASEAN leaders on 6 September 2016. </p>

In 2005-6, the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) initiated a humanitarian reform process to improve the effectiveness of humanitarian response through greater predictability, accountability, responsibility and partnership. </p>
                <p> One of the major adaptations of the Humanitarian Reform process was the adoption of the Cluster Approach to humanitarian coordination. <button type="button" class="btn-tootltip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Cluster Approach is covered in more detail in Chapter IV “International Coordination Mechanisms”">7</button> The IASC Guidance Note on “Using the Cluster Approach to strengthen humanitarian response” (2006) spells out the responsibilities of global and country-level sector/cluster leads, provides guidance on application of the Cluster Approach in new emergencies, and reinforces partnerships and complementarity. Additional responsibilities for cluster leads are addressed in the “Operational Guidance on Responsibilities of Cluster/Sector Leads and UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Information Management” (2008). The guidance clarifies information management roles in a humanitarian emergency, and promotes effective information </p>
                <p> management, facilitates situational understanding and decision-making, and ensures that information management activities support existing national information systems, standards, and local capacities. </p>
                <p> In 2011, the IASC Principals conducted a further review of humanitarian action and in December 2011, adopted a ‘Transformative Agenda’, a set of actions to improve the humanitarian response model. Following the agreement, the Transformative Agenda Protocols were endorsed. These established the parameters for improved collective action in humanitarian emergencies. The Protocols are: </p>
                <ul class="lower-latin">
                    <li><strong>Concept Paper on ‘Empowered Leadership’</strong> (revised March 2014) clarifies what is meant by the concept of ‘empowered leadership’ during the initial three-month period following the declaration of a Level 3 (L3) emergency. It details the responsibilities of the humanitarian coordinator (HC) in setting priorities and planning; leading overall cluster coordination; leading engagement and advocacy with national authorities and donors; ensuring information and monitoring of the response; leading humanitarian funding strategies; and strengthening accountability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humanitarian System-Wide Emergency Activation: definition and procedures</strong> (April 2012)details the exceptional measures that should be applied for when an L3 emergency is declared to ensure that there is adequate capacity and tools for enhanced leadership and coordination of the humanitarian system. It also engages IASC member organizations to ensure that they put in place the right systems and that they mobilize resources to contribute to the response.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responding to Level 3 Emergencies: What ‘Empowered Leadership’ looks like in practice</strong> (November 2012) outlines the additional authority that an HC has in the initial phase of an L3 response to make timely decisions in the following key areas: setting overall priorities, allocating resources, monitoring performance and dealing with underperformance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reference Module for Cluster Coordination at the Country-level</strong> (revised in July 2015) outlines the basic elements of cluster coordination and serves as a reference guide for field practitioners to facilitate their work and improve humanitarian outcomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humanitarian Programme Cycle Reference Module Version 2.0</strong> (July 2015) defines the roles and responsibilities of international humanitarian actors. It also outlines how they interact in different contexts with each other, with national and local authorities, with civil society and with those affected by crises. These contexts include preparing for emergencies, assessing needs, planning, implementing and monitoring response, mobilizing resources, and conducting peer assessments of response. 14</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability to Affected Populations Operational Framework (March 2015)</strong> summarizes the key concepts for making programming at the field level more accountable to affected populations. It also helps implementing agencies find practical entry points for improving accountability to affected populations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inter-Agency Rapid Response Mechanism (IARRM) Concept Note</strong> (December 2013) provides a summary of the purpose and scope of the IARRM, the required capacities and training of staff deployed through the IARRM, information on how the IARRM is activated, and funding for the mechanism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Common Framework for Preparedness</strong> (October 2013) reviews the rationale for establishing the Common Framework, its Operating Principles, the actions taken as part of the Common Framework and its indicators of success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Response Preparedness Guidance</strong> (draft for Field Testing issued in July 2015) assists Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators and Humanitarian Country Teams in preparing to respond to potential emergencies with appropriate humanitarian assistance and protection. It is a tool for developing a common understanding of risks, establishing a minimum level of multi-hazard preparedness and taking additional action, including the development of contingency plans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Sector Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA) Guidance</strong> (revised in July 2015) explains the purpose of joint data collection and shared analytical processes and outlines the key steps required to undertake a joint needs assessment, as well as associated roles and responsibilities.</li>

                    <span><a href="https://www.agendaforhumanity.org/" title="" target="_blank">World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) Agenda for Humanity</a></span> identifies voluntary commitments for reducing suffering and delivering better assistance to people caught in humanitarian crises. The WHS took place in Istanbul, Turkey in May 2016 and brought together 9,000 participants, representing UN Member States, international and regional organizations, international, national and local civil society organizations, as well as the private sector and academia. In the two years leading up to the WHS, eight multi-stakeholder regional consultations, one global consultation, and numerous stakeholder- or industry- specific consultations were held, and the results contributed to shaping the WHS agenda. The Agenda for Humanity, developed by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, was an outcome of the WHS. As a result of the WHS more than 3,500 commitments to action were generated. For more information: <a href="https://www.agendaforhumanity.org/" target="_blank"> www.agendaforhumanity.org</a>
                </p>
                <p> One key outcome of the WHS was the Grand Bargain on Efficiency. It was first proposed by the former UN Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing as one of the solutions to address the humanitarian financing gap. The goal of the Grand Bargain is for both donors and agencies to make changes so that aid delivery is more efficient and human and financial resources are freed up for the direct benefit of affected populations. </p>
                <p> The Grand Bargain consists of five strategic priorities, which largely relate to headquarter- level funding and administrative arrangements, as well as five operational priorities that reflect the way humanitarian agencies should be implementing their programs. These ten priorities include reducing donor earmarking and increasing multi-year and flexible funding, ensuring greater agency transparency, expanding cash programming, strengthening localization of responses, and cutting bureaucracy through harmonised reporting requirements. </p>
                <p> A second key outcome of the WHS was the New Way of Working. It aims to improve collaboration between humanitarian and development actors, Governments, NGOs and private sector actors. According to the New Way of Working, having diverse actors working towards collective outcomes will more effectively reduce needs, risk and vulnerabilities. Wherever possible, these collaborative efforts will reinforce and strengthen previously existing capacities at the national and local levels. </p>

It improves both the quality of assistance provided to people affected by disasters as well as the accountability of humanitarian actors to the affected people, donors and partners. Sphere standards guide humanitarian action across four primary areas: (1) water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion; (2) food security and nutrition; (3) shelter, settlement and non-food items; and (4) health action. There is also a series of Sphere companion standards, published as separate volumes, which are built on the same foundation, informed through the same process of consultation, and compiled with the same rigour as the Sphere Handbook (2011). These companion standards include: </p>

                    <span><a href="https://corehumanitarianstandard.org/the-standard" title="" target="_blank">Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability (CHS)</a></span> is the result of a global consultation process, drawing together key elements of existing humanitarian standards and commitments. It sets out Nine Commitments that organizations and individuals involved in humanitarian response can use to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance they provide and to facilitate greater accountability to communities and people affected by crisis (Figure 4). The CHS describes the essential elements of principled, accountable and high-quality humanitarian action. Humanitarian organizations can align their own internal procedures with the CHS and also use it as a basis for verification of performance. </p>

The MISP ensures an organization is identified to coordinate the response for sexual and reproductive health; prevents and manages the consequences of sexual violence; reduces HIV transmission; prevents maternal and new-born death and illness; and promotes integration of comprehensive sex and reproductive health care with primary health care. These actions are the starting point for reproductive health coordination and programming, and they provide the foundation for additional services through the response and recovery period. They should be sustained and expanded with comprehensive reproductive health services throughout protracted crises and recovery. The MISP was developed in 2010 through the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) on Reproductive Health in Crises in collaboration with UNFPA and partners. The IAWG encourages humanitarian actors, policymakers and donors to become more aware and responsible for implementing this critical tool. The tool is currently under revision, but the objectives remain similar. It is expected to be launched mid-2018. </p>

In particular, they call on humanitarian actors to ensure that human rights principles are integrated into all disaster response and recovery efforts, and that affected people are fully consulted and can participate in all stages of disaster response. The Operational Guidelines, published in 2011, are based on existing human rights law and humanitarian accountability standards. </p>

The Oslo Guidelines also address the use of MCDA following natural, technological and environmental emergencies in times of peace. MCDA should be requested only where there is no comparable civilian alternative and only when MCDA meets a critical humanitarian need. If MCDA are required, the Oslo Guidelines outline the procedures for requesting and coordinating MCDA. The Guidelines were released in 1994 and revised in 2007. </p>

Disaster waste is a well-recognized threat to health, safety and the environment, and it can also be a major impediment to post-disaster rescue operations. These guidelines focus on situations where the local and regional waste management systems are not able to cope with the quantities and composition of wastes generated by a disaster or conflict. The guidelines provide advice and tools to overcome these challenges and successfully manage disaster waste in emergency and early recovery phases. They were developed collaboratively by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and the UN Environment / OCHA Joint Unit (JEU) in 2011. </p>

They are (1) Leadership, (2) Participation and Partnership, (3) Information, Feedback and Action, and (4) Results. These commitments reflect essential developments such as the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS), and the work done by the IASC on Inter-Agency community- based complaints mechanisms, including Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). They also reflect the importance of meaningful collaboration with local stakeholders. The latter was a priority recommendation from the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit as well as the Grand Bargain. </p>
